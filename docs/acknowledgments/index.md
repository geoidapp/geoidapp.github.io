# Acknowledgments
We would like to acknowledge the following authors/institutions, individuals, etc.

- Ahmed Abdalla. He is our supervisor, he is the guy behind all of these things, without him none of this will ever happen. I know words cannot describe what we want to say. I really don't have anything to say.

- The guy behind copy/paste. I don't know you, but you're a hero in my eyes. I owe just everything.
- KAT, TPB and the rest of torrent websites. You are the one good thing in this crazy world. Thank you from the deepest point in my heart.

- Authors of Matplotlib. Seriously? It's away better than Matlab, even though it was a mimic for it.

- Authors of NumPy, SciPy, Juypter notebook, etc. Kudos guys. I can "أحنّك" and do other cool stuffs, that is awesome!

- Whom else?

  - Professor Munir (Surveying Dep.) You're the man. Your silence doesn't mean you have nothing useful to say. You just don't give a damn shit. Kudus Munir!

  - Aisha. She was kinda helpful, although she didn't do anything at all.

- The corner "الركن". It was definitely the best spot in the college, with the best friends, I love you all.

- Ahmed Alamin. I just love you man, and you know that. You are the best guy I've ever met.

- HER -- I just appreciate everything you have done for me. I can't say how pleased am I.
