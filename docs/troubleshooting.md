## Troubleshooting

There is a very good chance that you screwed things yourself LOL just kidding! I cannot list whole possible pitfalls in this application, there so many for that matter. The thing is, if you have a problem regarding installation you may want to try and look at [installation](getting-started-guides/geoidapp). You will probably find a solution there. If you have any sort of other problems e.g. wrong results etc (how would you even know that?) just contact us. Or better make a pull request.
