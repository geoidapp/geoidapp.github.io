## FAQs

### Will it be open source?

I really don't know. I believe there will be an open source version of GeoidApp. I'm not sure whether we open-source the whole suite, or make a seperate open source version. I don't like the idea of selling an application, but if we don't have a money we will not be able to maintain it, and other projects. Another thing, I want to get married, I need the money :P Girls always push you in the wrong direction. Honestly though, it's very complicated.

### Why there is not a GUI yet?

Because I'm kinda perfectionist! I hate Matlab GUIDE, so I stuck with the command line version, until we figure a way to make a nice GUI. We have different choices, Microsoft Visual Studio is in the top of them. We have a GUI for the mobile version, and it's really cool supporting Google's Material Design concepts. We will have a web version very soon, and it'll definitely come with a nice styling.
